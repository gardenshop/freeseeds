# Status

## Current State

`WHATSAPP_NUMBER_PENDING`

## Completed Work

- Repository audit confirmed an empty directory with no Git history or legacy architecture.
- Existing WhatsApp numbers and WABAs are explicitly prohibited for this phase.
- Governance and corrected plan are being bootstrapped.
- Dedicated clean Cloudflare account `Get Free Seeds` created and verified; Account ID recorded as `cb5066a6d71ecdee0bd7ed8aacb4d3c2`.
- Staging D1, private R2 bucket, event Queue, and DLQ created in the clean account.
- Staging public API and admin Workers deployed on `get-free-seeds.workers.dev`; API health verified publicly and admin health verified through Cloudflare Access.
- Cloudflare Zero Trust Free activated with explicit authorization; admin Access application allows only `gisupp@gmail.com`.

## Verification

- No live WhatsApp number has been used.
- No prohibited Meta test number has been used; a clean staging WABA/test number is now allowed but not yet configured.
- No paid ad spend has been initiated.

## Blockers and Gates

- New production WhatsApp number is not yet provided; this is a deferred external gate, not an engineering blocker.
- Clean Meta portfolio/WABA and Page isolation remain future integration gates.
- Verified Garden Shop recipient details are not yet available; payment methods remain safe-disabled until supplied.
- R2 onboarding was explicitly authorized; dashboard verified $0.00 current billable usage and no public bucket access.
- TypeScript build, ESLint, unit/domain tests, and simulated WhatsApp E2E all pass.
- Implementation base is merged at `28c0bcc`; WABA staging branch commits `8a23811`/`6db14be` are pushed. The earlier `ai-photo-studio` 403 was repaired without bypassing access controls.
- GitHub authentication is `gardenshop`; `codex/gfs-waba-test-002` is pushed and PR #2 is open against `main`.
- PR #2 is merged into `main` at `d8b0511`; `main` has no branch protection. Remote CI is optional/unavailable (`REMOTE_CI_UNAVAILABLE_NON_BLOCKING`), so local release checks are active.
- Minimal CI workflow is locally verified with `npm ci`, Vitest 5, build, lint, and zero dependency audit findings; remote check was triggered but blocked before start by GitHub billing lock.
- CI workflow is present, but GitHub runners cannot start because the account is locked due to billing. No billing mutation was attempted; this is non-blocking for launch preparation.
- Cloudflare UI re-verification confirmed clean account context, D1 ID/table count, private R2 (`Public Access: Disabled`), Queue/DLQ IDs, Worker names/subdomain, and Access behavior.
- Hardened API/admin Workers deployed and health-verified; staging bindings show only the clean D1/R2/Queue resources.
- Payment model migration is applied and verified in staging: D1 `payment_methods`, private R2 QR validation/storage, Access-only admin configuration/preview, audited updates, method selection, and receipt-request outbox. No real payment values are configured.
- Latest payment-aware API/admin versions deployed: `d4aff2d9-1c27-41f5-a01c-22208a37eb78` / `46efab4b-796f-4422-b4bf-639930b11904`.
- Browser protocol is locked: authenticated `gisupp@gmail.com` profile, same-task tab reuse, no duplicate dashboard tabs, and account verification before mutations.
- `STAGING_WABA_TEST_ALLOWED` is active for a future clean Meta-provided staging WABA/test number only; production remains `WHATSAPP_NUMBER_PENDING`.
- Clean WABA staging setup is blocked by Meta's visible business-portfolio creation limit while the available existing portfolios/assets are not independently clean; no existing portfolio/WABA/app/test number was used.
- Read-only audit proved candidate `Garden Shop OK` also contains a Hoja Seeds ad account; it is excluded. No clean suitable portfolio/WABA/test number is currently available.
- Meta alternative-path audit found no no-portfolio WhatsApp sandbox; Meta app creation requires a business portfolio selection for the WhatsApp use case. Support path investigation is in progress; no support case has been submitted yet.
- Meta support case: not created; no clean WABA/test context or support-case ID is available. This remains a platform-enforced external gate.
- Deployed staging smoke passed with synthetic-only data: Flow/D1 persistence, JazzCash/Easypaisa/Bank selection, receipt request, mock media retrieval, private R2 receipt write, and `PAYMENT_REVIEW`; synthetic methods/fixtures were restored/removed afterward.
- Two integration defects were repaired during smoke testing: payment-selection and receipt-request audit SQL placeholder counts.
- Final regression also repaired ESLint traversal of managed `.kilo/worktrees`; `.kilo/**` and `.wrangler/**` are now ignored, and sequential `npm test` (18/18), build, lint, audit all pass.
- Production D1 `02b707df-a10c-4645-9516-a2a4541f6fab`, private R2, Queue `9b1852f6976343de8bec95ef2cf152a4`, and DLQ `0313fc16837d41bdb8370cf8fe31c969` exist in the clean account; migrations 0001/0002 applied and payment methods verified disabled. Production Workers, Access, secrets, and callbacks remain gated.

## Next Action

Obtain a clean Meta WABA test context or submit a Meta support request when an authenticated support form is available; production stays `WHATSAPP_NUMBER_PENDING`.
